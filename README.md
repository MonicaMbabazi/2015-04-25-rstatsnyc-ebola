If you are reading this, then I haven't updated the readme with instructions and all that fancy stuff yet.

In the meantime I gave a similiar tutorial a week ago at a DC meeup here:

There will be a new release version when I have the readme all ready.  Should be done early next week.

If you want leave a commet in the issues tab :)
